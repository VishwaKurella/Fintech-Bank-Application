## Installation

To set up App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Begin by cloning the app repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Or using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   App requires specific environment variables for proper configuration. Next.js provides a straightforward method for managing these variables:

   - **Create a `.env.local` File**:

     In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env.local`. This file will store all your environment-specific variables, ensuring they are not exposed in version control systems like Git.

     ```bash
     touch .env.local
     ```

   - **Add Environment Variables**:

     Open the `.env.local` file and add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations:

     ```env
     # NEXT.js Configuration
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=<your-site-url>

     # Appwrite Configuration
     NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
     NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=<your-appwrite-project-id>
     APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=<your-database-id>
     APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID=<your-user-collection-id>
     APPWRITE_BANK_COLLECTION_ID=<your-bank-collection-id>
     APPWRITE_TRANSACTION_COLLECTION_ID=<your-transaction-collection-id>
     APPWRITE_SECRET=<your-appwrite-secret>

     # Plaid Configuration
     PLAID_CLIENT_ID=<your-plaid-client-id>
     PLAID_SECRET=<your-plaid-secret>
     PLAID_ENV=<plaid-environment>
     PLAID_PRODUCTS=<plaid-products>
     PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=<plaid-country-codes>

     # Dwolla Configuration
     DWOLLA_KEY=<your-dwolla-key>
     DWOLLA_SECRET=<your-dwolla-secret>
     DWOLLA_BASE_URL=https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com
     DWOLLA_ENV=sandbox
     ```

     **Note**: In Next.js, environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser, while others are available only on the server side. For more details, refer to the [Next.js documentation on environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   Start the development server to launch App locally:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev

   # Or using yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
